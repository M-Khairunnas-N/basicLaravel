1. laravel using MVC paradigm

2. public/index.php is entry point for our program:
    in index we execute: laravel, composer, bootstrap, kernel, and request

3. kernel in laravel have 2 kernel:
    a. HTTP kernel serve HTTP or web request, first request accepted in
    public/index.php and continue to Kernel class in app/Http folder.
    Bootstrapping in kernel is a Core logic process so that we can receive
    request from Web and handling that request, so we can respond, but this
    just load service provider class in app/providers folder
    b. Console kernel to serve console request.

4. Service provider that do bootstrapping for all component in laravel like:
    database, queue, validation, routing, etc. This process is like
    init.php in our first program in "Project_Tatib" third semester IT
    Polinema. There is a Class in app/Providers that important for basic,
    that is RouteServiceProvides, this class handling routing from our URL
    like what controller and method that we execute for some feature in web

5. this some request cycle: Request->public/index.php->Kernel(if HTTP
    request accepted in HTTP kernel usually for web application, and if
    console request or console application accepted in app/console/Kernel
    .php or console kernel)->Service_Provider(do multiple bootstrapping for
    all component)->if Routing we use RouteServiceProviders
    Class->app/routes folder for more specific routing

6. in laravel there are 2 Testing method:
    a.Unit test: unit testing is test that focus on testing small unit like
    function, method, class, and other component. This test is made to our
    unit code is running in isolation environment without dependency to
    other unit or outside environment. use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
    and this test much faster than integration because we
    haven't loaded our laravel. You can use artisan command to make Unit
    Test: "php artisan make:test NameUnitTest --unit".
    b. integration test: test that focus in interaction between unit in some
    big accumulation unit, like interaction view, controller and model
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase to make integration test.
    This test is much easy to access our laravel component like Database,
    Controller, and other compare to Unit Test also if you use laravel
    feature u must use integration test. To make integration test u can use
    artisan command: "php artisan make:test NameIntegrationTest".
    If you want to run all test
    you can use artisan command: "php artisan test"
    Notes: in function name in our testing class must prefix with test

7. environment setting in laravel much easier with help .env file in our
    project, you can add, edit, and delete manually in there without setting
    environment variable manually in our system.Laravel in function env()
    or you can use Env::get() have default value if our env var hadn't
    existed, here some example:
    env(key, default) => env("THIS_KEY", "DEFAULT")

8. Application environment: sometimes we want to set our application
    running in which environment like: local, development, staging, Qa or
    Production, so in laravel you can change that by edit APP_ENV in .env.
    Note: if you make UnitTest or Integration Test, and want to check your
    application environment, laravel will override your APP_ENV to "testing"
    in file phpunit.xml, this is code: <env name="APP_ENV" value="testing"/>
    If you want to know which app env you code running you can use function
    "App::environment() or App::environment([value1, value2]
    (this for multiple value check)"; so you haven't used function
    env("APP_ENV") to check that

9. Configuration: Environment variable in .env used for configuration that
    always change or frequent to change and integrate in environment
    variable in OS; but laravel also support configuration setting with
    PHP code, this configuration usually used when configuration haven't
    frequently change and this usually same with other app location when
    running, this type configuration is saved in config folder in laravel
    and prefix for this configuration start with name php file within there
    To make config file, you can make file .php in config folder and inside
    that you can return associative array and to receive configuration, you
    can use function => config(key, default)
    with key is "prefix(or nameFile).arrayKey(if nested array you can use .
    like: example.author.first)"
    Note: if you make some file in config folder, try to make file name
    with lowercase

    9.A configuration cache: sometimes we had crated to many config files
    that result in laravel must read all that when we get config, in
    development this seems
